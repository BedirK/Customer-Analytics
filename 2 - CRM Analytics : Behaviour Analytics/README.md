# CRM Analytics

CRM and Behavior Analytics combine to provide a deep understanding of customer preferences and online actions. Using these insights, companies can refine their marketing and enhance digital engagements.

## Behaviour Analytics

Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analysis is a powerful tool that evaluates multiple dimensions of customer behavior. By assessing tenure, retention, recency, frequency, monetary value, and basket size, companies gain a comprehensive understanding of customer engagement and transaction patterns.

| Term | Description |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Tenure**  | How long a customer has been with the company |
| **Retention**| The ability to keep customers over time|
| **Recency**| Time between the last transaction made and the analysis date|
| **Frequency**| Number of transactions (How often a customer makes transactions)|
| **Monetary**| Total price of the transactions|
| **Basket Size**|  The number/value of items in a single purchase|
