# Customer Journey

In the modern business landscape, achieving success goes beyond having a high-quality product or service. It now depends on delivering outstanding experiences throughout the entire customer journey. By thoroughly understanding and mapping this journey, organizations can gain valuable insights into customer motivations, needs, and pain points. This insight enables the creation of personalized experiences that deeply connect with customers.

Customers are not just looking for practical benefits; they also desire meaningful experiences that align with their values and aspirations.

The customer journey typically involves various key stages, such as:

 *Customer Journey Milestones, Example Touchpoints, Importance, Success Level (positive/Negative)*

**Presales** 

*Awareness* - *Research* - *Engagement with Marketing Channels* - *First Contact*

 At this stage, potential customers first learn about a business, product, or service, often through ads, word-of-mouth, or online research using tools like web analytics. During this phase, customers actively explore available options, analyzing features, pricing, and other relevant factors. They may gather data, scrutinize reviews, or utilize analytics tools to make informed decisions. 

**Purchase**: The customer hits the milestone of deciding to make a purchase and finalizing the transaction. It could be an online purchase, a visit to a physical store, or signing a contract for a service. This phase is often a significant point of conversion and revenue, tracked through transactional data.

**Onboarding**: After the purchase, customers engage with the product or service. This milestone involves using the product, receiving delivery, attending training sessions, or obtaining installation or setup support. Analyzing these interactions through product analytics is crucial for assessing customer satisfaction and predicting future loyalty.
Under all these parameters, there are 3 satisfaction and experience measurement methods

**Usage / Unexpected Cases / After-Sales Services**: This stage involves customers seeking assistance or support from the business. It could be related to product inquiries, technical issues, returns, or general customer service needs. Providing prompt and effective support during this stage is essential for maintaining a positive customer experience, tracked through customer support analytics.

**Retention**: When customers opt for repeat purchases or renew contracts, it indicates their satisfaction and loyalty. This milestone is a tangible sign that the business has successfully retained the customer, tracked through customer retention metrics, and analyzed for insights on improving strategies.

In the realm of customer experience, each touchpoint, from the initial interaction to post-purchase engagements, significantly influences customer perceptions, playing a crucial role in establishing enduring relationships

Assessing the importance and success level of every milestone is crucial.

CSS, NPS, and ExS are the 3 metrics for understanding brand performance.

- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS)**: is a metric to quantify the satisfaction level of customers regarding a product, service, or the overall experience offered by a business. The CSS is typically measured through customer surveys or feedback mechanisms where customers are asked to rate their satisfaction on a scale, often ranging from 1 to 5, from “Very Unsatisfied” to “Very Satisfied”. (Likert type scale, the range can be also 7 or 11)

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: is a frequently utilized metric in assessing customer loyalty and predicting business expansion. It furnishes businesses with valuable insights into the likelihood of their customers recommending their products, services, or brand to others.

 Promoters (Score 9–10): These are the customers who express high satisfaction, actively advocate for the business, and exhibit strong loyalty.

  Passives (Score 7–8): Customers falling into this category are moderately satisfied. They may not actively endorse the business, but they also refrain from negative remarks. Their stance is neutral, and they could be influenced by competitors' offerings.

Detractors (Score 0–6): Detractors represent dissatisfied customers who may have faced negative experiences or unresolved issues. They pose a risk of spreading negative word-of-mouth, potentially impeding business growth.

- **Experience Survey (ExS)**: is structured to collect data on day-to-day business experiences. Its objective is to extract insights regarding our proximity to achieving predefined key success indicators.
