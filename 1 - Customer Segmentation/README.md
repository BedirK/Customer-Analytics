## Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers into segments up based on demographics, behaviors, and characteristics. The best and the smartest way to build strategy.

By understanding that each customer is different, segmentation helps companies tailor their marketing and services to better connect with specific groups. This ensures a more personalized and effective approach.

Effective segmentation goes beyond just basic details like age or gender. Understanding the deep motivations and interests of the audience helps create a strategy. By using these insights, businesses can build strong connections and provide exceptional value to their customers.

There are four ways to group customers as segments, and using combination of these segments, known as hybrid segmentation, is the best way to do this. This approach helps us organize and analyze different aspects more effectively. 

 - **Profile Based** (Demographics, Social class, Culture, Geographic)

 - **Psychographic Based** (Personality Lifestyle Social Status, AIO (Activities, Interests, Opinions), Attitudes)
   
 - **Behavioral Based** (Benefits, Usage, Price or promotional sensitivity, Buying situation, Economic)
   
 - **Value Based** (Revenue, Profit, Cost, Churn, Loyalty)

For example, the Customer RFM Analysis is an example of a behavioral and value-based type of segmentation. Check for details [CRM Analytics](https://github.com/BedirK/Customer-Analytics/tree/main/2%20-%20CRM%20Analytics%20%3A%20Behaviour%20Analytics)

For the latest trend in digital marketing data and segmentation, our strategy should focus on creating segments that are easy to **measure** and can be accessed in **real-time**. Each segment should respond promptly to specific marketing messages and remain relevant in the moment.

In data analysis, systematic processes of segmentation and data mining occur as shown in these frameworks. It starts with defining the problem and gaining an understanding of the business requirements, right through to the deployment phase. 

Segmentation has 3 levels as clustering and it is a type of unsupervised learning that groups and interprets data based only on the input data.
